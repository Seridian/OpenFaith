## The Essence
1. The world that we live in is a gift to all of God's creations. It is a place full of wonders that we are to explore and try to 
understand and that we are to cherish and consider precious.

2. God grants us our own choices and we are not to forfeit or make them lightly.

3. We are to look after our children, for they are our most precious creation. 

4. We are to teach our children our values of life but will not condemn them for choosing a religion of their own.

5. We are not to condemn anyone who follows the guidance of another Prophet or who knows God by another name.

6. We are not to spread hatred or fear. 

7. We are not to cause hurt or harm to another being. 

8. We are to look after our own health because our life is precious.

9. We are to consider our ideas precious and strife to share them.

10. We are to think for ourselves and refuse to be ignorant.

11. We are not to profit from or abuse the despair or urgencies or vulnerabilities of others.

12. We are not to wager on gambling or speculation but we are not to condemn those who do.

13. We are not to condemn those who make a wrong choice because they feel their choices are limited or because they follow instructions 
but we are never to put someone in such a situation.

14. We are to take part in society for as much as we can and for as much as the values of society don't contradict our own but we are 
not to condemn those who don't take as much part in society.

15. We are free to love whomever we want to as long as we cause no harm and are not to condemn those whose preferences deviate as long 
as they cause no harm.

16. We are to know that God feels all of our suffering as we are part of Him and He is part of us.  

17. God will forgive all that we truly regret.
