## Thoughts
God does not want us to know his name for us to worship him. He wants us to know His name for us to know that we are never truly alone, that there is purpose to our lives and that our struggles will not be for nothing.

We are not born burdened by sin for we are God's creation, He created use to be able to make mistakes and learn from them. God does not love us any less for making mistakes. It was part of His plan because He needs us to become wise and strong so we can stand by His side.
