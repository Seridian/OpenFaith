# OpenFaith

## God's love is simple. 
It does not involve hundreds of rules, preached by a Church you visit every Sunday and it isn't something secretive or inaccessible that can only be understood through tedious study of religious works. God's love is simply inside of us all and we don't need it explained once we felt it.

As a child I started to get the feeling that the things that were preached to me had little to do with the true love of God. Many times I have wondered, _"Why do people use a book of love to preach so much hate and fear?"_

I have come to see these books of love as stories God tells as father to His children, still to young to understand the real world, warning us of monsters in the forest so we don't run off and get lost. But we have gotten lost in the interpretation of these stories and lost the essence of what God's word. 

As a child I made the choice to keep my faith but leave my church. After getting lost in the endlessly varying interpretations of translations of books written in a context so different from today, I decided to write down the essence of my faith on a single page as my source of guidance in life.

## Open Faith
I believe faith is not something that should be owned by any institutions. God's love lives in us all and belongs to us all and it is something I hope we all get to experience some time in our life. So I decided to upload the essence of my faith, in my words, licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).

I entrust these values I live by to you in good faith. Anyone can fork and collaborate and keep the wording of these values relevant for the era we live in and true to the love of God.
